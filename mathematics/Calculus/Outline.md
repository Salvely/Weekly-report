  - Straight line
    - slope
    - equation
    - slop-point form
    - general form
    - parallel & perpendicular lines
  - Circles
  - Parabola
- Functions
  - one to one / multiple to one mappings
  - composite functions
  - polynomials -> rational functions
  - rational functions
  - algebraic functions
  - transecendental functions
- Graph of a functions
  - discontinuty

- some important trigonometric functions

## Derivative

### Definitions

- What is Calculus? 
  - Differential Calculus: The problem of **Tangents**
    -  Let Q be a second nearby point on the curve, and draw the secant line PQ. 
    -  The tangent line at P can now be thought of as the limiting position of the variable secant as Q slides along the curve toward P
  - Integral Calculus: the problem of **Area**
- Slope Calculation
  - Definiton: the slope of the secant line as P approaches Q (but not equal)
  - $\Delta$ notation
  - The slope definition: $f\prime(x_{0}) = \lim\limits_{\Delta{x}\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x_{0} + \Delta{x}) - f(x_{0})}{\Delta{x}}$
  - tangent existence
    - must the same limit approaching from left or right
- Definition of Derivative
- Velocity & the rate of change. Newton & Leibniz
- Concept of a limit & Two Trigonometric Limits
- Continuous Functions
- Mean Value Theorem & Other Theorems
