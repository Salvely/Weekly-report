# Thread

## Components

1. Thread execution state (like process state: running, ready, blocked...).
2. Saved thread context when not running.
3. Execution stack.
4. Local variables.
5. Access to the memory and resources of the process (shared with all threads in that process).

## Thread over Process

- Creation faster
- Terminate & Clean up faster
- less time context switch
- Communication easier
- Unblock

## Applications

- Foreground & Background work
- Asynchronized Processing
- Speed of Execution
- Modular Structure

## Problems

- Concurrency
- One thread termination affects other threads
